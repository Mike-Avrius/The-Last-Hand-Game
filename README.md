# The Last Hand

**The Last Hand** is a casual suspense game created as a final project for the *Introduction to Unity* course at **Tiltan School of Design and Visual Communication**.  

The game is based on a unique twist on the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** mechanic: **Rock-Paper-Scissors Minus One**.

## 🎮 Overview
In this game, you face an opponent in a tense battle of wits. Both participants start with two hands and choose shapes for each hand (rock, paper, or scissors). After seeing your opponent’s choices, you must **decide which hand to remove**. Your opponent does the same, and then the remaining shapes are compared.

The goal is simple: **win the round, take all the coins, and survive**. Coins represent your lives — when you run out, the game is over.
